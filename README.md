# Milk Tea Website with AI
This is a useful demo project for helping people choose their drinks based on their recent mood. Developed as a project for my final exam using Reactjs, Flask, Tensorflow.

Install all packages needed for the project
```bash
npm install

For using AI functions:
- Open your Python IDE

- Run the repo you just cloned to get the server started
## Usage
Start the Web by running the command bellow in terminal:
```bash

After running that commnand, you will get the web started on http://localhost:3000. Then you can use it.
## Note
You need to start both Web and Server from the repo mentioned above so the app can work properly.
